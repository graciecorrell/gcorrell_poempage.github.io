<h1 style="text-align:center">The Fruit-Gift</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">By John Greenleaf Whittier</h2>
<p style="text-align:center"> Last night, just as the tints of autumns sky<br/>
    Of sunset faded from our hills and streams,<br/>
    I sat, vague listening, lapped in twilight dreams,<br/>
    To the leafs rustle, and the crickets cry.</p>
	
<p style="text-align:center"> Then, like that basket, flush with summer fruit,<br/>
    Dropped by the angels at the Prophets foot,<br/>
    Came, unannounced, a gift of clustered sweetness,<br/>
    Full-orbed, and glowing with the prisoned beams<br/>
    Of summery suns, and rounded to completeness<br/>
    By kisses of the south-wind and the dew.<br/>
    Thrilled with a glad surprise, methought I knew<br/>
    The pleasure of the homeward-turning Jew,<br/>
    When Eshcols clusters on his shoulders lay,<br/>
    Dropping their sweetness on his desert way.</p>
	
<p style="text-align:center"> I said, This fruit beseems no world of sin.<br/>
    Its parent vine, rooted in Paradise,<br/>
    O ercrept the wall, and never paid the price<br/>
    Of the great mischief, an ambrosial tree,<br/>
    Edens exotic, somehow smuggled in,<br/>
    To keep the thorns and thistles company.<br/>
    Perchance our frail, sad mother plucked in haste<br/>
    A single vine-slip as she passed the gate,<br/>
    Where the dread sword alternate paled and burned,<br/>
    And the stern angel, pitying her fate,<br/>
    Forgave the lovely trespasser, and turned<br/>
    Aside his face of fire; and thus the waste<br/>
    And fallen world hath yet its annual taste<br/>
    Of primal good, to prove of sin the cost,<br/>
    And show by one gleaned ear the mighty harvest lost.</p>
